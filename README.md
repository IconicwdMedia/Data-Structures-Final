# Data-Structures-Final

# Final Submission: ADT Visualization

This project is designed to visualize various Abstract Data Types (ADTs), including Heap, Binary Search Tree (BST), and Stack & Queue, using the SFML graphics library. It provides a user-friendly interface to toggle between these data structures and visualize their operations.

## Project Structure

- **Heap.h** & **Heap.cpp**: Contains the implementation of the heap data structure and associated visualization functions.
- **BST.h** & **BST.cpp**: Contains the implementation of the binary search tree (BST) data structure and its visualization.
- **StackQueue.h** & **StackQueue.cpp**: Contains the implementation of stack and queue operations and their visual representation.
- **main.cpp**: The main file that handles the program logic, including the menu interface, event handling, and rendering of selected data structures.
- **Font.zip**: Contains the required font files (arial.ttf) for visualization.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies:

- **SFML**: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library used for graphics.
  - Install SFML on Linux using:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
    ```
  - On macOS, use Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install sfml
    ```
